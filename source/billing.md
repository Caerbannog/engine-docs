## FAQs

### What happens when I cross the 1 million free queries for the first time?

Once your Engine account crosses the 1 million query threshold, you will be prompted to enter payment information. This will be used to bill your account for any usage at the end of your monthly billing period. **Without a valid payment information on file for your account, you will not be able to access any performance metrics or error reporting features after you exceed the first 1 million queries during a monthly billing period.** Once valid payment information is added, you will be able to begin using Engine functionality again.

### Do you offer prepaid discounts?

Yes, please contact [support@meteor.com](mailto:support@meteor.com) for more information on prepaid discounts and annual payment options. 

### How do I cancel my Engine subscription?

To request an account cancellation, click “Cancel Subscription” in “Settings” under the organization's drop down menu in the upper left-hand corner: See “Cancel Account” in the “Danger Zone” and cancel the subscription. Be aware that by cancelling, **all members in your Github organization will also lose Engine access**.

Cancelling your account means your Engine account no longer accept data from any service; you will also lose access to all Engine features and historic data. Your account will be billed immediately for any paid usage during current billing period.
