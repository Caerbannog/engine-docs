<h3 id="crossing-million" title="Crossing 1 million queries">What happens when I cross the 1 million free queries for the first time?</h3>

Once your Engine account crosses the 1 million query threshold, you will be prompted to enter payment information. This will be used to bill your account for any usage at the end of your monthly billing period.

**Without a valid payment information on file for your account, you will not be able to access any performance metrics or error reporting features after you exceed the first 1 million queries during a monthly billing period.** Once valid payment information is added, you will be able to begin using Engine functionality again.

<h3 id="prepaid-discounts" title="Prepaid discounts">Do you offer prepaid discounts?</h3>

Yes, please contact [support@apollographql.com](mailto:support@apollographql.com) for more information on prepaid discounts and annual payment options.

To request an account cancellation, click “Cancel Subscription” in “Settings” under the organization's drop down menu in the upper left-hand corner: See “Cancel Account” in the “Danger Zone” and cancel the subscription.
